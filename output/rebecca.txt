Sometimes she
Suddenly she
Suddenly she turned

Reluctantly she
Reluctantly she left

clumsily I
I felt very
That is

Maybe there
Maybe there was
usually I
I never
I never talked

Perhaps you
Somehow, I
me thoughtfully

it well
me better
it still
still my
her at
yet we
yet we climbed
he laughed no
longer, he
more, we

Then you
Suddenly he
Suddenly he began
He never
it quite
something rather
there were too
Perhaps she

Soon we
it tightly
that still
that still remained
long they
too my
Somehow I
so I
so I sat
I leant back
I felt rather
furtively I
furtively I laid
my broad
all so
he came away

it carefully
before, her
he never
he never talks

her now
you never
you never have

you still serve
me well
even our
again who

We drove east
east, we
east, we drove
we drove west
her now
now, her
Already she
Already she belonged
then it
then it came
Soon we
only there
I said impulsively
it never
it never faded
it never
it never got
I knew then
him dreadfully
then she
I said savagely
he said gravely
he laughed inwardly
all very
you -I
you -I know
you know then
There, I
it silently
it back
back, it
again I
again I saw
now, I
now, I thought
him again
we did before
even that
I even
I even saw
myself back
He sat motionless
too, who
Then he
Then he turned
ago you
ago you talked
I think rather
ago that
ago that altered
we took together
I sat still
still, my
Swiftly we
Swiftly we covered
swiftly, I
swiftly, I thought
no more
suddenly he
suddenly he put
then he
then he threw
who looked pretty
that stretched ahead
afterwards she
Later her
he stood away
he said suddenly
again he
's ever
's ever think
it again
me long
I smiled then
he laughed back
I almost
I almost had
first he
me too
everything more
she said casually
I believe so
us together
she put away
I never
I never saw
all very
I threw away
Somewhere her
them still
him thus
Here, I
Here, I say
ourselves behind
it no
Here I
then I
then I open
She stayed behind
Perhaps there
Perhaps there is
mine no
first she
first she looked
I said lamely
wretchedly, my
She laughed disagreeably
me away
you properly
him again
over, there
you so
me before
again, it
me curiously
there's too
then no
itself perhaps
myself back
much I
much I knew
Still I
So there
myself alone
Perhaps it
wide my
There I
even my
then, I
any more
already, my
perhaps he
now she
now she wants
you again
this before
She only
She only decided
her then
Instinctively I
There were only
about an
mine already
now she
now she wants
you come home
it away
I said slowly
anything at
I had once
so it
so it finished
it finished there
me sometimes
I rather
I rather thought
you dreadfully
me very
you again
So that
I also
I also like
he still
he still laughing
then you
suddenly I
suddenly I realized
together, we
I knew now
you look so
back his
he spoke so
we went along
this alone
soon you
soon you marry
anywhere you
Naturally I
Then I
Then I went
Perhaps he
Perhaps he said
all very
They suddenly
They suddenly decided
there it
anything yet
it away
they ever
they ever
they ever call
him then
Then I
Then I went
Then it
Then it crumpled
it crumpled too
even, it
so I
again, her
I realize now
me curiously
curiously, she
curiously, she ran
any more
more, I
more, I wash
I rather
I rather wonder
You certainly
I always
I always said
So I
you here
you really
now, you
now, you know
I simply
course he
personally I
personally I think
Perhaps she
her again
course I
Soon she
now there
he nearly
he nearly went
He admitted as
He just
myself now
they rolled away
much he
much he guessed
I knew then
perhaps their
Surely it
me now
now, I
you down
you probably
he said absently
Here we
I shrank back
them now
Perhaps he
Perhaps he guessed
nothing else
first, I
first, I dare
just her
who long
now I
now I belonged
I belonged here
here, this
me now
I too
here there
here there was
still there
still there was
that further
that further bend
I leant forward
Suddenly I
Suddenly I saw
now, I
now, I saw
there it
she knows perfectly
well I
it now
here we
it here
you home
both well
then you
We went together
so her
once she
once she considered
me ill
him at
then he
then he bore
then they
then they left
soon she
soon she had
he live alone
they never
they never sat
again he
again he looked
who sat alone
he sat now
perhaps he
that never
that never came
I leant back
mine now
mine now
together, we
it did now
them always
then I
slowly, my
here, you
here, you know
me intently
I looked round
then she
then she turned
I went at
we stood now
she just
she just went
However, it
it very
Then this
her again
I said awkwardly
all right
I understood too
perhaps you
anyone else
so you
more, I
more, I glanced
I came here
Still her
something surely
again I
again I saw
again I
again I had
first I
her too
still she
I only
I only followed
she still
she still had
us once
she said suddenly
you so
me curiously
me again
Then I
Then I saw
she drew back
He looked round
I always
I always thought
I always
I always thought
then she
then she turned
He came away
he said abruptly
I turned away
She seems just
perhaps she
perhaps she thought
then he
then he turned
he turned away
she really
she really makes
me though
me better
I said quickly
all, it
something else
perhaps she
then he
then he stopped
me very
much, I
we even
we even had
he always
he always does
I sat there
Unconsciously, I
Unconsciously, I shivered
him there
I remember now
I got downstairs
We always
We always help
I remember well
all thrown away
I very
I half
I half expected
you so
this hardly
Then he
Then he picked
us walking together
I lingered long
Perhaps it
Perhaps it
Perhaps it lowered
Perhaps they
I went upstairs
I quickly
I quickly went
I crept downstairs
me again
Presently all
so I
so I went
I said awkwardly
I felt rather
I thought perhaps
perhaps I
well I
I turned away
I went recklessly
You go straight
I said humbly
them round
myself sitting ever
me at
once, his
Somehow I
Somehow I guessed
there they
even his
it so
I noticed then
Somehow I
I knew already
it again
it again
it back
somebody else
I had unforgivably
me there
I sat there
I never
I never noticed
I only
I only wondered
that is
is, I
I searched feverishly
I glanced hurriedly
I always
I always had
I hardly
I hardly know
you usually
you usually have
I rather
I rather think
me at
she said no
then I
then I heard
Then I
Then I looked
who sat here
I knew so
it extravagantly
here I
I backed again
I went quickly
it nearly
I stood there
them aside
I listened now
now, my
I knew then
then I
them very
Somehow I
I went back
directly she
directly she saw
I just
I just opened
you have only
Perhaps you
you all
I'd rather
you have only
me vaguely
then you
You have only
through, her
Then you
I felt suddenly
me wandering perhaps
I glanced back
I blundered in
once, it
once, it seemed
Here she
you nearly
you nearly trod
me straight
secretly what
me again
you only
you only got
you so
it yet
you know perfectly
well you
you went away
he look well
him even
I said shyly
him better
we had really
he has exactly
rather he
rather he looked
again, I
away, my
All very
I said swiftly
I realized suddenly
suddenly what
he always
he always looks
me saying so
you very
she laughed lightly
we always
we always bicker
you again
all very
she said no
him never
again he
again he remembered
I always
I always tell
you think so
She turned away
him as
him politely
last he
last he paused
He frowned very
you came back
we strolled backwards
something else
all happened very
you very
her very
pretty, I
course we
course he
course he adores
something else
alike, you
alike, you know
You never
You never know
then it
he ever
who never
who never stood
me saying so
it back
I did so
me critically
critically, her
I never
perhaps he
perhaps he likes
him too
I wear at
She looked away
she said suddenly
anyone quite
her before
course I
I ever
I ever want
However, she
efficiently, there
efficiently, there's
course she
nothing more
me uncertainly
all, that
She simply
She simply adored
he looks quite
you very
them again
Perhaps that
me now
me now
I sat here
us again
I always
I always imagined
this again
perhaps what
though, this
Here we
Here we sat
we sat together
We wandered slowly
she belonged here
she ever
she ever thought
then, you
you never
you never put
too, which
it very
So she
all, it
You probably
I gave rather
She has damn
one never
she stopped abruptly
I always
I always expect
you very
so we
you before
before, you
him so
I run upstairs
he said impatiently
it hurriedly
she invariably
she invariably puts
it better
Perhaps he
he still
he still resented
her very
Someone much
now, his
course I
course I like
I just
I just wondered
presently I
presently I looked
He seemed all
I thought too
Perhaps she
We stood quite
us too
they grew together
them still
There I
Here it
I stood straight
it almost
it almost hurts
then we
then we looked
we looked round
I looked anxiously
Perhaps he
Perhaps he
best I
There was still
I climbed down
I saw then
he backed away
nothing at
me uncertainly
me now
I said gently
him back
I went inside
me again
nothing at
I never
I never said
He turned abruptly
we going back
he said briefly
he said shortly
then he
then he added
together, there
together, there were
him walk up
you walk so
me instead
now you
no more
You just
You just say
I said wearily
all, you
all, you began
right, I
I never
I never go
I first
I first met
he said roughly
It hurts too
last we
last we came
I knew now
he knew best
He went straight
back my
I turned away
me though
though, he
though, he began
I stood there
me still
I walked slowly
any more
you so
me very
I sank back
her too
it again
I took apiece
I felt very
I remembered then
I did so
so I
so I noticed
it still
it before
it surely
then I
then I knew
it often
that never
that never ceased
sometimes I
there, my
it too
that grew slowly
himself again
He walked alone
I looked steadily
naturally, he
I first
I first anticipated
them perhaps
me again
I never
I never used
even, I
even, I think
again I
they drove away
She scarcely
She scarcely opened
me ever
Sometimes I
so I
so I
We always
We always have
I suddenly
I suddenly opened
it again
herself again
I knew all
I suppose so
They danced there
all so
it so
too, we
too, we went
Everything always
course, she
her at
myself saying boldly
it aloud
her greedily
You never
You never met
her then
We never
We never knew
her well
personally, you
personally, you know
We dined there
everything too
often you
often you get
her now
her so
I often
I often discuss
Besides, you
Besides, you have
I suppose so
she said briskly
he went round
afterwards, they
indeed I
I knew all
home I
home I sat
her again
them again
They only
They only came
any more
more, I
more, I decided
all, who
I leant forward
who lived there
me blankly
I leant back
I smiled back
Perhaps it
Sometimes they
Sometimes they do
it very
I said carelessly
I looked straight
us worked pretty
he said quietly
I wondered suddenly
that very
it excellently
I almost
I almost believed
me really
it again
he always
he always potters
I said lightly
it looked quite
then she
then she converted
I still
I still humming
I said brightly
you ever
you ever go
he said quietly
suddenly, I
suddenly, I wondered
She often
She often went
he said shortly
anyone swimming there
he minded so
Suddenly I
I said rapidly
I just
I just wondered
now he
Perhaps I
me again
it always
it always reminds
I said desperately
only that
sometimes I
sometimes I feel
all very
me looking very
someone there
there who
all naturally
that mean most
so, I
you very
He looked very
him far
all, I
I always
I always imagined
anything else
perhaps you
I said gravely
one think immediately
I said hastily
him more
us away
us back
this before
Already they
Already they looked
them away
something quite
well, I
it always
it always did
he said slowly
I ever
I ever saw
She kept very
She still
She still rang
myself rather
her once
She looked almost
I wrote quickly
me no
I often
I often wondered
something rather
just me
me personally
personally she
personally she hated
she simply
she simply adored
Somehow I
sometimes I
sometimes I felt
I carried now
perhaps it
something rather
They swayed dangerously
I stood back
Perhaps I
Perhaps I moved
I moved too
he did so
I glanced hurriedly
Then I
Then I took
She never
She never opens
anything about
surely one
once his
me nearly
someone else
someone else did
it very
you before
you say so
you much
me go upstairs
I looked nervously
I never
I never thought
all along
Perhaps you
me personally
I said wretchedly
there myself
Better you
I said slowly
I have so
We nearly
We nearly gave
I knew now
Perhaps that
course I
who just
who just judge
I hardly
I hardly think
all very
that ever
that ever interests
anybody down
them then
I only
I only said
he said slowly
It just
It just came
me moodily
moodily, his
He spoke slowly
I felt very
There are too
I said hurriedly
course we
you more
I never
I never gave
I wonder sometimes
course I
I just
I just said
surely you
I said eagerly
I smiled too
we sit here
course we
course we
you say so
then it
it too
just me
any more
he had before
then, that
me again
I dress badly
badly, I
you dressed badly
you so
you really
you really think
it very
I suppose so
I believe so
they looked well
they always
I suppose so
him swiftly
Perhaps he
Perhaps he came
she then
we had only
Nothing very
you looked so
I felt exactly
him again
I came back
I scarcely
I scarcely read
I felt physically
quickly he
quickly he got
I felt very
I had just
it at
Perhaps I
yet, they
yet, they made
there I
Now I
now, any
any more
I said aloud
There was only
comfortably I
comfortably I supposed
Perhaps it
I come back
Only it
I went back
I walked slowly
all, it
Nothing at
Besides, they
deeply, his
I went slowly
anybody there
me stupidly
stupidly, his
he kept behind
behind his
it again
I said firmly
I walked quickly
Then I
Then I shut
I saw then
I said gently
I never
I never told
you away
I turned away
Here, I
Here, I got
He smiled foolishly
foolishly, he
foolishly, he beckoned
He grinned again
her here
me intently
her once
me here
here I
this here
he said anxiously
I said slowly
I turned away
Perhaps he
himself discussed once
I glanced back
someone waited down
we ran together
here, their
it too
they had though
though, they
that well
I had better
I did so
so I
so I noticed
then he
he drew back
myself yet
Perhaps it
directly he
directly he saw
he whipped back
Still, that
exactly my
I strolled rather
me still
Evidently this
I went along
I felt rather
I did so
I darted back
me away
I stood very
Then I
Then I heard
I looked round
then I
then I heard
me at
anyone look more
him away
away, it
he said heartily
I just
I just popped
you really
Then he
Then he pulled
you really
I never
I never minded
somebody else
him well
I felt quite
there you
he laughed again
She just
She just went
all it
She spoke quietly
He looked very
I felt very
perhaps you
He still
He still spoke
I felt very
I said feebly
you probably
you probably rested
all walked out
I hardly
I hardly expected
She looked very
I slipped round
He looked inquiringly
it heartily
me always
you again
him slowly
you living somewhere
he said carelessly
I said awkwardly
Sure you
Perhaps I
He laughed again
you well
I walked slowly
I rang again
I rather
I rather fancied
now I
then he
all very
still I
it written once
there was only
I stood there
I remembered then
she sat there
there I
me too
I walked slowly
her back
It felt as
mine though
somebody else
it well
There was always
Often you
Often you forgot
I always
I always look
Surely I
Surely I had
it still
it back
I did so
so I
so I noticed
I moved away
here, I
here, I caught
me now
I went back
Then I
Then I heard
round I
round I saw
I felt very
I backed away
she went silently
it usually
you never
you never asked
you before
You had only
Now you
it always
always, it
it again
she never
she never came
it back
me better
You never
She only
She only wore
her then
Here, I
you ever
you ever see
them yet
they ever
it now
here she
close, her
He went quite
She always
She always listened
doubt, she
doubt, she telling
she always
she always did
he got back
back, I
back, I dare
I went downstairs
I came upstairs
then he
then he came
all, she
all, she spent
She paused again
then I
there any
any longer
there was still
She turned away
You know now
he slept much
I too
I too
any more
again you
again you have
you have only
You have only
her everywhere
You do too
me curiously
here, I
her just
it anywhere
her leaning there
her there
she said slowly
Sometimes I
Sometimes I wonder
Sometimes I
Sometimes I wonder
she comes back
We stood there
Then she
Then she opened
He came back
She stepped aside
Then I
Then I lay
I thought perhaps
me push back
back my
Just his
Perhaps I
you about
right, my
you later
I wandered back
There were so
them again
they crept nearer
there was always
you waited there
there, your
I did then
here I
me somewhere
she said immediately
I said humbly
who ever
who ever has
you looked quite
you before
she said shortly
I said awkwardly
I never
I never turned
You only
You only need
she swept by
I felt rather
I crouched lower
what else
course he
Really, some
I always
I always think
all round
However, it
we have really
We often
We often say
What exactly
exactly it
exactly it had
I smiled politely
another so
Perhaps I
course our
now, there
now, there is
they had there
you ever
you ever heard
him once
perhaps he
I rather
I rather think
He probably
He probably used
him much
it wiser
Besides, we
She glanced curiously
we came close
Here we
here, nothing
you before
I too
I too bent
course we
now, she
well, I
well, I suppose
I ever
I ever had
I thought perhaps
perhaps it
Perhaps you
There are so
She laughed heartily
So she
So she gave
Nobody ever
Nobody ever gave
She laughed again
it half
I felt rather
she too
She looked more
all finished now
it right
right, it
she got home
she ever
she ever think
she too
she too have
nothing left behind
here, you
here, you know
course we
course we have
too, that
Perhaps she
now it
so, it
she said vaguely
you know perfectly
she lives there
You talk too
much, all
Then she
Then she looked
you before
She too
it sometimes
it sometimes lasts
She turned apologetically
I said quickly
Now, what
I stared straight
I said hurriedly
She knew all
She only
She only connects
she ever
she ever took
her always
course she
I repeated mechanically
it matter after
rather it
I never
now I
she said gratefully
I did now
me briefly
I now
I now walked
last I
last I saw
I ran quickly
I came near
near I
near I heard
I slipped away
I ran swiftly
Then I
Then I went
I went slowly
me though
he swung round
it now
him very
away, I
you terribly
I just
I just held
I always
I always hate
that drive twice
I knew then
I said slowly
us looking forward
I always
I always loathed
myself rather
I never
I never knew
it very
he quietly
her too
anyone else
anyone else has
it so
it again
course I
somebody else
There you
There you see
I said uncertainly
course she
more I
course they
There you
surely you
surely you care
me doubtfully
perhaps he
perhaps he thought
he knew only
well, I
you then
I went back
I thoroughly
I thoroughly enjoyed
you truthfully
you truthfully think
anything else
you really
you really believe
here, you
here, you know
You just
You just receive
Perhaps you
I turned away
he never
he never knew
I said slyly
me solemnly
he turned rather
anything at
I suddenly
I suddenly announced
something else
it rather
it rather added
I never
I never dress
it now
right, that
it always
it always going
He away
we never
together, he
I stood there
there I
there I wondered
nothing else
him saying so
nobody else
I dreaded even
so, she
me more
I shuddered now
It seemed so
herself so
first I
that away
you personally
So you
yet what
I wondered privately

He always
He always does
I wonder Then
Then I
Then I noticed
he put away
there's now
we thoroughly
we thoroughly enjoyed
us soon
Soon there
I wandered back
I never

I nearly jumped
him away
overhead, they
Nothing happened at
He emptied about
He stood there
