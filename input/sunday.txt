White. A blank page or canvas. 
The challenge: bring order to the whole.

Composition
Tension

Light
And harmony. 

[DOT, spoken]
George. 
Why is it you always get to sit in the shade while I have to stand in the sun?
Hello, George?
There is someone in this dress!

(sung)
A trickle of sweat
The back of the head
He always does this—
Now the foot is dead
Sunday in the park with George
One more Su—

The collar is damp
Beginning to pinch
The bustle's slipping—
I won't budge one inch

Artists are bizarre. Fixed. Cold. 
That's you, George, you're bizarre. Fixed. Cold. 
I like that in a man. Fixed. Cold. 
God, it's hot out here

Well, there are worse things
Than staring at the water on a Sunday
There are worse things
Than staring at the water
As you're posing for a picture
Being painted by your lover
In the middle of the summer
On an island in the river
On a Sunday

The petticoat's wet
Which adds to the weight
The sun is blinding
All right, concentrate
[GEORGE, spoken]
Eyes open, please. 

[DOT]
Sunday in the park with George!

[GEORGE, spoken]
Look out at the water, not at me

[DOT]
Sunday in the park with George!

Well, if you want bread
And respect and attention
Not to say connection
Modeling's no profession

If you want instead
When you're dead
Some more public and more permanent
Expression—
Of affection—
You want a painter
Poet
Sculptor, preferably
Marble, granite, bronze
Durable
Something nice with swans
That's durable
Forever
All it has to be is good
And George, you're good
You're really good
George's stroke is tender
George's touch is pure

Your eyes, George
I love your eyes, George
I love your beard, George
I love your size, George
But most, George
Of all
But most of all
I love your painting...
I think I'm fainting...

The tip of a stay
Right under the tit
No, don't give in, just—
Lift the arm a bit...

[GEORGE, spoken]
Don't lift the arm, please. 

[DOT]
Sunday in the park with George!

[GEORGE, spoken]
The bustle high, please. 

[DOT]
Not even a nod
As if I were trees
The ground could open
He would still say, "Please"

Never know with you, George
Who could know with you?
The others I knew, George
Before we get through
I'll get to you, too
God, I am so hot!

Well there are worse things
Than staring at the water on a Sunday
There are worse things
Than staring at the water
As you're posing for a picture
After sleeping on the ferry
After getting up at seven
To come over to an island
In the middle of a river
Half an hour from the city
On a Sunday
On a Sunday in the park with—

[GEORGE, spoken]
Don't move the mouth!

[DOT]
—George!

If my legs were longer...

If my hands were graceful...
If my waist was thinner...
If my hips were flatter...
If my voice was warm...
If I could concentrate—

I'd be in the Follies!
I'd be in a cabaret!
Gentlemen in tall silk hats
And linen spats
Would wait with flowers
I could make them wait for hours
Giddy young aristocrats
With fancy flats
Would drink my health
And I would be as
Hard as nails...
And they'd only want me more—
If I was a Folly girl...
Nah, I wouldn't like it much
Married men and stupid boys
And too much smoke and all that noise
And all that color and light...

[GEORGE, spoken]
Aren't you proper today, miss? Your parasol so properly cocked, your bustle so perfectly upright. And you, sir. Your hat so black. So black to you, perhaps. So red to me. 

[DOT]
None of the others worked at night...

Color and light!

[DOT, spoken]
But how George looks. He could look forever. 

[GEORGE]
There's only color and light

[DOT, spoken]
As if he sees you and he doesn't all at once. 

[GEORGE]
Purple and white...

[DOT, spoken]
What is he thinking when he looks like that?

[GEORGE]
...And red and purple and white!

[DOT, spoken]
What does he see? Sometimes, not even blinking. 

[GEORGE]
Look at this glade, girls
Your cool blue spot

[DOT, spoken]
His eyes. So dark and shiny. 

[GEORGE]
No, stay in the shade, girls
It's getting hot...

[DOT, spoken]
Some think cold and black. 

[GEORGE]
It's getting orange...

[DOT]
But it's warm inside his eyes...

[GEORGE]
Hotter...

[DOT]
And it's soft inside his eyes...
And he burns you with his eyes...

[GEORGE, spoken]
Look at her looking. 

[DOT]
And you're studied like the light

[GEORGE, spoken]
Forever with that mirror. What does she see?

[DOT]
And you look inside the eyes

[GEORGE, spoken]
The pink lips, the red cheeks...

[DOT]
And you catch him here and there

[GEORGE, spoken]
The wide eyes. Studying the round face, the tiny pout...

[DOT]
But he's never really there

[GEORGE]
Seeing all the parts and none of the whole. 

[DOT]
So you want him even more

[GEORGE]
But the way she catches light...

[DOT]
And you drown inside the eyes...

[GEORGE]
And the color of her hair...

[GEORGE & DOT]
I could look at her / him forever...

[GEORGE, spoken]
It's going well. 

[DOT, spoken]
Should I wear my red dress or blue?

[GEORGE, spoken]
Red. 

[DOT, spoken]
Aren't you going to clean up?

[GEORGE, spoken]
Why?

The Follies, George!

[GEORGE, spoken]
I have to finish the hat. 

Damn! The Follies. Will she yell or stay silent? Go without me or sulk in the corner? Will she be in the bed when the hat and the grass and the parasol have finally found their way?

Ruff! Ruff!
Thanks, the week has been rough!
When you're stuck for life on a garbage scow
Only forty feet long from stern to prow

And the wind is rough
And the master's drunk and mean and—
Grrrruff! Gruff!

Poking among the roots and rocks
Nose to the ground on Sunday

There's a thistle...
That's a shallot...

Off of the lady's lap at last

Wash and brush

We scrape their plates
And dust their knickknacks
Hundreds to the shelf

Louis's cakes are an art
Louis isn't the smartest—
Louis's popular
Everybody loves Louis
Louis bakes from the heart...

Hardly anything worth objection
Louis drinks a bit
Louis blinks a bit
Louis makes a connection

We lose things
And then we choose things
And there are Louis's

Well, Louis's

But George has George
And I need someone—
Louis...
Everybody loves Louis
Him as well as his cakes
Everybody loves Louis

Mapping out a sky
What you feel like, planning a sky
What you feel when voices that come
Through the window
Go
Until they distance and die
Until there's nothing but sky

And how you're always turning back too late
From the grass or the stick
Or the dog or the light
How the kind of woman willing to wait's
Not the kind that you want to find waiting
To return you to the night
Dizzy from the height
Coming from the hat

Studying the hat
Entering the world of the hat
Reaching through the world of the hat
Like a window
Back to this one from that

Studying a face
Stepping back to look at a face
Leaves a little space in the way like a window
But to see—
It's the only way to see
And when the woman that you wanted goes
You can say to yourself, "Well, I give what I give"
But the woman who won't wait for you knows
That however you live
There's a part of you always standing by
Mapping out the sky
Finishing a hat
Starting on a hat
Finishing a hat...
Look, I made a hat...
Where there never was a hat


[DOT, spoken]
Yes, George, run to your work. Hide behind your painting. I've come to tell you I am leaving because I thought you might care to know—foolish of me, because you care about nothing. 

[GEORGE, spoken]
I care about many things— 

[DOT, spoken]
Things—not people. 

[GEORGE, spoken]
People, too. I cannot divide my feelings up as neatly as you, and I am not hiding behind my canvas—I am living in it. 

[DOT]
What you care for is yourself

[GEORGE, spoken]
I care for this painting. You will be in this painting.

Tell me that you're bored—
Anything, but don't assume I know
Tell me what you feel!

You know exactly how I feel
Why do you insist
You must hear the words
When you know I cannot give you words?
Not the ones you need

There's nothing to say

[LOUISE]
I can't see anything

[BOATMAN]
Why are they complaining?
It could have been raining

[DOT]
I hate these people

[ALL]
It's hot up here
A lot up here
It's hot up here
Forever

A lot of fun
It's not up here
It's hot up here
No matter what
There's not a breath
Of air up here
And they're up here
Forever

It's not my fault
I got up here
I'll rot up here
I am so hot up here

[YVONNE, spoken]
Darling, don't clutch Mother's hand quite so tightly. 
Thank you. 

[CELESTE #1]
It's hot up here

[FRIEDA]
At least you have a parasol

[SOLDIER, NURSE, YVONNE & LOUISE]
Well, look who's talking
Sitting in the shade

[JULES, spoken]
I trust my cigar is not bothering you.—unfortunately, it never goes out. 
[SOLDIER, (to COMPANION)]
It's good to be together again

[CELESTE #2]
See, I told you they were odd

[CELESTE #1]
Don't slouch

[LOUISE]
He took my glasses!

[YVONNE]
You've been eating something sticky

[NURSE]
I put on rouge today, too...

[FRIEDA]
Don't you ever take a bath?

[OLD LADY]
Nurse! Hand me my fan

[NURSE]
I can't

[FRANZ]
At least the brat is with her mother

[LOUISE]
I heard that!

[JULES (to DOT)]
Do you like tall grass?

[FRIEDA]
Hah!

[YVONNE]
Jules!

[BOATMAN]
Bunch of animals...

[DOT]
I hate these people

[ALL]
It's hot up here
And strange up here
No change up here
Forever

How still it is
How odd it is
And God, it is
So hot!

[SOLDIER, spoken]
I like the one in the light hat. 

[DOT]
Hello, George
I do not wish to be remembered
Like this, George
With them, George
My hem, George
Three inches off the ground
And then this monkey
And these people, George—!

They'll argue till they fade
And whisper things and grunt
But thank you for the shade
And putting me in front
Yes, thank you, George, for that—
And for the hat...

[CELESTE #1]
It's hot up here

[YVONNE]
It's hot and it's monotonous

[LOUISE]
I want my glasses!

[FRANZ]
This is not my good profile

[CELESTE #1]
I hate this dress

[DOT]
It's hot up here

[CELESTE #2]
The soldiers have forgotten us

[FRIEDA]
Don't you ever take a bath?

[YVONNE]
It's hot and it's monotonous

[LOUISE]
He took my glasses, I want my glasses!

[BOATMAN]
Animals...

[SOLDIER]
It's good to be together again

[JULES]
Are you sure you don't like tall grass?

[OLD LADY]
Nurse! Hand me my fan

[FRANZ]
This is not my good profile

[ALL]
And furthermore
Finding you're
Fading
Is very degrading
And God I am so hot!

Well, there are worse things than sweating
By a river on a Sunday
There are worse things than sweating by a river—

[BOATMAN]
When you're sweating in a picture
That was painted by a genius—

[FRANZ]
And you know that you're immortal—

[FRIEDA]
And you'll always be remembered—

[NURSE]
Even if they never see you—

[OLD LADY]
And you're listening to drivel—

[SOLDIER]
And you're part of your companion—

[LOUISE]
And your glasses have been stolen—

[YVONNE]
And you're bored beyond endurance—

[LOUIS]
And the baby has no diapers—

[CELESTE #1 (to CELESTE #2)]
And you're slouching—!

[CELESTE #2]
I am not—!

[JULES]
And you are out of all proportion—

[DOT]
And I hate these people!

[ALL]
You never get
A breeze up here
And she's (he's) up here
Forever

You cannot run
Amuck up here
You're stuck up here
In this gavotte

Perspectives don't
Make sense up here
It's tense up here
Forever

The outward show
Of bliss up here
Is disappear-
Ing dot by dot

And it's hot!


[HARRIET]
I mean, I don't understand completely—

[BILLY]
I'm not surprised

[HARRIET]
But he combines all these different trends

[BILLY]
I'm not surprised

[HARRIET]
You can't divide art today into categories neatly—

[BILLY, spoken]
Oh. 

[HARRIET]
What matters is the means, not the ends

[BILLY]
I'm not surprised

[HARRIET & BILLY]
That is the state of the art, my dear
That is the state of the art

[BOB GREENBERG]
It's not enough knowing good from rotten–

[CHARLES REDMOND]
You're telling me

[GREENBERG]
When something new pops up every day

[REDMOND]
You're telling me

[GREENBERG]
It's only new, though, for now—

[REDMOND]
Nouveau

[GREENBERG]
But yesterday's forgotten

[REDMOND]
And tomorrow is already passe

[GREENBERG]
There's no surprise
[REDMOND & GREENBERG]
That is the state of the art, my friend
That is the state of the art

[BETTY]
He's an original

[ALEX, spoken]
Was. 

[NAOMI]
I like the images

[ALEX, spoken]
Some. 

[BETTY]
Come on, you had your moment
Now it's George's turn

[ALEX]
It's George's turn?
I wasn't talking turns
I'm talking art

[BETTY]
Don't you think he's original?
[NAOMI]
Well, yes

[BETTY]
You're talking crap

[ALEX]
But is it really new?

[NAOMI]
Well, no...

[ALEX]
His own collaborator—!

[BETTY]
It's more than novelty

[NAOMI]
Well, yes...

[BETTY]
It's just impersonal, but—

[ALEX]
It's all promotion, but—

[ALEX & BETTY]
That is the state of the art
Isn't it?

[NAOMI, spoken]
Well...

[BILLY]
Art isn't easy

[HARRIET]
Even when you've amassed it

[BETTY]
Fighting for prizes—

[GREENBERG]
No one can be an oracle

[REDMOND]
Art isn't easy

[ALEX]
Suddenly, you're past it

[NAOMI]
All compromises—

[HARRIET]
And then when it's allegorical—!

[REDMOND & GREENBERG]
Art isn't easy—

[BETTY & ALEX]
Art isn't easy—

[NAOMI, HARRIET & BILLY]
Art isn't easy—

[ALL]
Any way you look at it!

[GREENBERG, spoken]
Here's George now!

[GEORGE]
All right, George
As long as it's your night, George—
You know what's in the room, George:
Another Chromolume, George
It's time to get to work...

[GREENBERG, spoken]
George! I want you to meet one of our board members. This is Harriet Pawling. 

[HARRIET, spoken]
What a pleasure! And this is my friend, Billy Webster. 

[BILLY, spoken]
How do you do. 

[GREENBERG, spoken]
Well, I'll just leave you three to chat. 

[HARRIET, spoken]
Oh...

[GEORGE]
Say "cheese," George
And put them at their ease, George
You're up on the trapeze, George
Machines don't grow on trees, George
Start putting it together...

[HARRIET, spoken]
This is the third piece of yours I've seen. They are getting so large!

[GEORGE]
Art isn't easy
Even when you're hot

[BILLY, spoken]
Are these inventions of yours one of a kind?

[GEORGE]
Advancing art is easy—

(spoken)
Yes. 

(sung)
Financing it is not

[GEORGE]
A vision's just a vision
If it's only in your head
If no one gets to see it
It's as good as dead
It has to come to light!
(spoken)
I put the names of my contributors on the side of each machine. 

[HARRIET, spoken]
How clever!

[GEORGE]
Bit by bit
Putting it together
Piece by piece—
Only way to make a work of art
Every moment makes a contribution
Every little detail plays a part
Having just the vision's no solution
Everything depends on execution
Putting it together
That's what counts!

[HARRIET, spoken]
The Board of the Foundation is meeting next week...

[GEORGE]
Ounce by ounce
Putting it together

[HARRIET, spoken]
You'll come to lunch. 

[GEORGE]
Small amounts
Adding up to make a work of art
First of all you need a good foundation
Otherwise it's risky from the start
Takes a little cocktail conversation
But without the proper preparation
Having just the vision's no solution
Everything depends on execution
The art of making art
Is putting it together
Bit by bit

[REDMOND, spoken]
Oh, we haven't met. Charles Redmond, County Museum of Texas. I wanted you to know we're in the process of giving out some sizable commissions—

[GEORGE]
Link by link
Making the connections

[REDMOND, spoken]
I hope you don't mind my bringing up business during a social occasion. 

[GEORGE]
Drink by drink
Fixing and perfecting the design
Adding just a dab of politician
(Always knowing where to draw the line)
Lining up the funds, but in addition
Lining up a prominent commission
Otherwise your perfect composition
Isn't going to get much exhibition

Art isn't easy
Every minor detail
Is a major decision
Have to keep things in scale
Have to hold to your vision

Every time I start to feel defensive
I remember lasers are expensive 
What's a little cocktail conversation
If it's going to get you your foundation
Leading to a prominent commission
And an exhibition in addition?

[ALL]
Art isn't easy—

[ALEX & BETTY]
Trying to make connections

[ALL]
Who understands it?

[HARRIET & BILLY]
Difficult to evaluate

[ALL]
Art isn't easy

[GREENBERG & REDMOND]
Trying to form collections

[ALL]
Always in transit

[NAOMI]
And then when you have to collaborate—!

[ALL]
Art isn't easy
Any way you look at it!

[RANDOLPH, spoken]
George, hello. Lee Randolph. I handle the public relations for the museum. 

[GEORGE]
Dot by dot
Building up the image

[RANDOLPH, spoken]
There's a lot of opportunity for some fine press here. 

[GEORGE]
Shot by shot—
Keeping at a distance doesn't pay
Still, if you remember your objective
Not give all your privacy away
A little bit of hype can be effective
Long as you can keep it in perspective
After all, without some recognition
No one's going to give you a commission

Art isn't easy
Overnight you're a trend
You're the right combination
Then the trend's at an end
You're suddenly last year's sensation

If you feel a sense of coalition
Then you never really stand alone
If you want your work to reach fruition
What you need's a link with your tradition
And of course a prominent commission
Plus a little formal recognition
So that you can go on exhibit—
So that your work can go on exhibition

[BLAIR, spoken]
There's the man of the hour. 

[GEORGE, spoken]
Blair! Hello. I read your piece on neo-expressionism—

[BLAIR, spoken]
Good for you!

[GEORGE, spoken]
Well, what did you think?

[BLAIR, spoken]
George. Chromolume number seven?

[GEORGE]
Be nice, George...

[BLAIR, spoken]
I was hoping it would be a series of three—four at the most. 

[GEORGE]
You have to pay a price, George

[BLAIR, spoken]
I've touted your work from the beginning, you know that. 

[GEORGE]
They like to give advice, George

[BLAIR, spoken]
You were really onto something with these light machines—once. 

[GEORGE]
Don't think about it twice, George...

[BLAIR, spoken]
Now they're just becoming more and more about less and less. 

[GEORGE, spoken]
I disagree. 

[BLAIR, spoken]
Now don't get me wrong. You're a talented guy. But I think you're capable of far more. 

[GEORGE]
"Be new," George
They tell you till they're blue, George

[BLAIR, spoken]
Not that you couldn't succeed by doing Chromolume after Chromolume—but there are new discoveries to be made, George. 

[GEORGE]
"You're new or else you're through, George"
And even if it's true, George
You do what you can do...

Bit by bit
Putting it together
Piece by piece
Working out the vision night and day
All it takes is time and perseverance
With a little luck along the way
Putting in a personal appearance
Gathering supporters and adherents—

[HARRIET]
But he combines all these different trends—

[GEORGE]
Mapping out the right configuration
Starting with a suitable foundation—

[BETTY]
He's an original—

[ALEX, spoken]
Was. 

[GEORGE]
Lining up a prominent commission 
And an exhibition in addition—
Here a little dab of politician

[BETTY]
I like those images

[GEORGE]
There a little touch of publication

[ALEX]
Some

[BETTY]
They're just his personal response

[ALEX]
To what?

[BETTY]
The painting! 

[GEORGE]
Till you have a balanced composition

[ALEX]
Bullshit. Anyway, the painting's overrated—

[GREENBERG]
It's only new, though, for now

[BETTY]
Overrated? It's a masterpiece!

[GEORGE]
Everything depends on preparation

[REDMOND]
Nouveau

[ALEX]
A masterpiece? Historically important, maybe—

[GREENBERG & REDMOND]
And yesterday's forgotten

[BETTY]
Oh, now you're judging Seurat, are you? 

[GEORGE]
Even if you do have the suspicion

[ALEX]
All it is is pleasant, just like George's work

[BETTY]
It's just your jealousy of George's work

[HARRIET]
You can't divide art today

[REDMOND]
And you can't tell good from rotten and—

[ALEX]
No nuance, no resonance, no relevance—

[BETTY]
There's nuance, and there's resonance, there's relevance—

[GEORGE]
That it's taking all your concentration

[BILLY]
I'm not surprised

[OTHERS]
Most art today

[GREENBERG & REDMOND]
Today it's all a matter of promotion

[ALEX]
There's not much point in arguing

[HARRIET]
Go with it

[BETTY]
No point in arguing

[OTHERS]
Is a matter of promotion, but then—

[GEORGE]
The art of making art

[ALEX]
Besides it's all promotion, but then—

[BETTY]
You say it's all promotion, but then—

[HARRIET and BILLY]
What will they think of next?

[ALL BUT GEORGE]
That is the state of the art

[GEORGE]
Is putting it together

[ALL BUT GEORGE]
And art isn't easy...

[GEORGE]
Bit by bit
Link by link
Drink by drink
Mink by mink

[ALL]
And that
Is the state of the—
Art!

Of course. That is your mother.

As it is that you like what you do"
Mama said, "Darling
Don't make such a drama
A little less thinking
A little more feeling—"
I'm just quoting Mama...

The child is so sweet
And the girls are so rapturous
Isn't it lovely how artists can capture us?

[GEORGE, spoken]
Yes it is, Marie. 

[MARIE]
You would have liked her—
Honey, I'm wrong
You would have loved her
Mama enjoyed things
Mama was smart
See how she shimmers—

Just wait till we're there, and you'll see—

The choosing was not
